## Halloween Week

Week numero 12 back in _"The States"_...

### 2016-10-31 - Monday

- [Things I'll Tell My Kids if They Become Entrepreneurs](http://www.slideshare.net/laurenthaug/things-i-will-tell-my-kids-if-they-become-entrepreneurs/54-644_things_that_lead_to)

- reading up on what the [top 3 licenses](http://choosealicense.com/) found on Github actually mean

- [How To Be a Better Writer (as told by Benjamin Franklin](http://marketmeditations.com/benjamin-franklin-learn-to-write/)
  1. DISSECT AND RECONSTRUCT
    - Take good writing and jot short notes for each sentence.
    - Put the notes aside and come back in a few days.
    - Try to “rewrite” the piece using only the notes (and in your own words).
    - Compare with the original and correct your faults.
  2. CONVERT TO POETRY (AND BACK AGAIN)
    - Take a story and convert it to poetry
    - Wait a few days
    - Convert your poem back to a story
  3. UNDERSTAND STRUCTURE
    - Take your notes from EXERCISE #1 and jumble them up
    - Wait a few weeks
    - Reassemble the sentences as best as you can
    - Get feedback by comparing to the original
  4. THE SECRET SAUCE
    - obsession
    - _"My time for these exercises and for reading was at night, after work or before it began in the morning, or on Sundays, when I contrived to be in the printing-house alone, evading as much as I could the common attendance on public worship…"_

[nickpsecurity](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nickpsecurity)'s comment from [**Minoca OS: A new open source operating system**](https://blog.minocacorp.com/minoca-os-a-new-open-source-operating-system-4bb7998df3a7)

Start with this paper which lays the reliability benefit out pretty well with specific examples:

http://cs.furman.edu/~chealy/cs75/important%20papers/secure%...

Start at "The Paper" here to skip past Linus vs Tannenbaum politics stuff. He describes the common counterpoints and shows with evidence, including existing systems, that they're not as big a deal as people say.

Example from high-assurance world that has many features & assurance activities a FOSS attempt at secure microkernels should consider copying:

Animats and I think QNX is probably best of commercial ones in balancing all kinds of tradeoffs. It's been used for decades as a self-healing RTOS with good performance. First link is their description of it with second a demo of a product with QNX inside showing how fast it can be on non-desktop hardware.

Open-source one aimed at reliability & legacy compatibility you can play with. Took UNIX decades to get reliable despite all the labor but Minix 3's foundation did it with a handful of people over a few years. That's saying something.

Another FOSS one that aims at high-security integrating many best-of-breed components from CompSci like Nitpicker GUI and seL4 microkernel. First link is descriptive slides with second the actual site. This one is still new so will have bugs.

Finally, it's worthwhile to throw in an exemplary one from capability-security that further isolates things with self-healing properties. Based on commercially successful KeyKOS system on mainframes. No longer maintained but docs and GPL code still available for study or revival. Paper also describes other capability kernels.

So, there's you a few days worth of reading and a few years worth of thinking to do. Hope it helps shed light on why almost every safety- or security-critical system that ever did well in reliability or security was a microkernel-based system. These days, high-assurance is looking at eliminating even it with CPU's with built-in security, compiler techniques for automated safety/security, and DSL's for easy formal verification of OS or system components. Until that's finalized & while using traditional hardware, it's best to build on methods that already worked for decades.
